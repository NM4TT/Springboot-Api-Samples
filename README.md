# Springboot-Api-Samples
API Samples with Springboot

This repository contains several types of APIs, developed with JDK17 and Springboot. 

Its purpose is to provide a base when developing APIs so you don't have to start with a blank project.

As time goes by, more projects will be added to the repository, to cover all possible types of APIs known.

It is important to mention that these projects are only examples so as not to start from scratch the development of an API. It is not required to follow the way they are implemented as this can always be improved.
